## Assignment 2
There is a clear difference in usage between winter and summer biking. Using Local
Spatial Autocorrelation, Manhattan is the center of the hotspot of usage, while outer
sections of Brooklyn are the cold spots. During the winter, Manhattan, particularly the
western coast, is a strong cold spot, while a patchwork of hot spots exist in inner Brooklyn
closer to the shore.

This pattern could be explained that during the winter, Manhattan, being more dense,
doesn't allow for winter cycling as easily as Brooklyn does with its wider streets
that can carry more snow. Another possible explanation is that Citibike usage shifts to
shorter, weekend trips near home during the winter rather than part of a regular commute.
Manhattan, still being the primary area where workers commute to, may see a strong reduction
in those kinds of trips, while Brooklyn, with its more residential and leisure make up,
may still support quick, cold Citibike trips.
