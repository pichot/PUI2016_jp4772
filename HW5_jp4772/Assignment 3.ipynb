    "Ideally, this experiment will have several test groups and a control sample. One test group will have all taken part in the the assigned diet. Another test group will have taken part in exercise. And the control group will have not taken part in either the diet or exercise. To make the experiment as good as possible, the control and the test groups should have similar demographics and human attributes. For example, they should have similar numbers of men and women, a similar distribution of ages, and similar health profiles and fat amounts before the experiment.\n",

    "*POLL RESULTS: On May 16, 1994, Newsweek reported the results of a public opinion poll that asked: “From everything you know about Bill Clinton, does he have the honesty and integrity you expect in a president?” (p. 23). Poll surveyed 518 adults and 233, or 0.45 of them answered yes.*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we have a yes/no question asked to a (hopefully) good sample of Americans. The polling question does not ask if a respondent trusts the president. Rather, it asks about their impression of his honesty and integrity in relation to the amount of honesty and intregity they expect from president. Answers to this question can range depending on their expectations of presidential honesty and integrity, as well as their knowledge of Bill Clinton. So, if we are to create a Null hypothesis regarding Americans' trust in the president, we will have to do it in a round about way. A possible Null hypothesis is:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The percent of Americans that rate the honesty and integrity of Bill Clinton as sufficient in a president is *less than or equal to* the percent of Americans that rate the honesty and integrity of Bill Clinton as insufficient in a president.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, if we reject the Null hypothesis, we can say that Americans have sufficient belief in the honesty and integrity of Bill Clinton, ergo that they trust the president. This is a bit of an awkward formulation but it works for the purposes of this exercise.\n",

    "\n",
    "A test like this runs into moral questions. It would not be correct to ask a woman to smoke during her preganancy to test it's effect. Rather, to create a sample and control group for this experiment we will need to find women who tell us that they smoked during their preganancy and those that did not. It will be hard to control for all variables here, but a best effort should yield two groups with similar health attributes. Since we're looking at IQ, the two groups of women should have similar distributions in IQ.\n",
