## Assignment 3
Worked through a z-test and chi-square test recreating the results published in the accompaning article.

## Assignment 4
Worked through a KS (one with smaller smample), Pearson's, Spearman's tests on Citibike dataset for the months
of January through June 2016. Found some interesting (and obvious) correlations. Spoke with Ian Wright on some
of the questions to gut check my results and conclusions.
