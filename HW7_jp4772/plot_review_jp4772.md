Hey Jonathan, I really like the effort that you put into making this plot, especially how you wrangled the data. Overall, it took me a while to understand what your plot is about because on the left y-axis you have units in counts, while on the right y-axis, you have units in dollars. This is a really great plot with a lot of information. I think itâ€™d really help if you labelled your bar plot in the legends as well. Good job!
